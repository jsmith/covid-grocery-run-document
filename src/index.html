    <h2 class="section">Game Overview</h2>
    <h2>Logline</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">COVID Grocery Run</span> follows an individual in the
      midst of the COVID-19 pandemic trying to get their groceries. This person
      must follow the recommended safety guidelines, including wearing a mask
      and following appropriate social distancing requirements or risk the
      consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>Genre & Themes</h2>
    <p>
      This game falls under the Action/Adventure RPG genre. Players will have
      real-time control over their character as they navigate the obstacles in a
      grocery store. Unlike many RPGs, there will be no combat abilities.
      Instead, players will continuously be on the defensive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The central themes of <span class="italic">COVID Grocery Run</span> are
      science and education. Players who have no previous knowledge of the
      <a
        href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/covid19.html"
        >safety guidelines</a
      >
      from Health Canada should have a basic understanding of some of these tips
      by the end of the game.

    <h2>Gameplay Example</h2>
    <p>
      You need to get bananas but the produce section is currently very crowded.
      To enter this section, you need to find the non-medical mask because it
      will not be possible to maintain the appropriate distance from others upon
      entering this section. Even with the mask, you must avoid others as much
      as possible while getting your bananas so that you lose minimal health
      points.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is it fun?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">COVID Grocery Run</span> aims to educate while
      entertaining at the same time. As levels increase in difficulty, players
      must improve their skills at detecting movement patterns and planning
      their routes so that they can ensure proper social distancing. Players
      will also be forced to use masks and sanitization stations to their
      advantage as both will be essential to completing the game.

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    There will only be one distinct character for this game, the individual on a
    mission to find all of their groceries. There will be numerous other people
    walking throughout the store; however, these people will be "strangers" and
    must simply be avoided. Due to the limitations of the selected character
    pack and time constraints, only two sprite sets will be used (selected at
    random for each "stranger") to populate the entire grocery store.

      movement. Two other character sprite sets will be used to animate the
      "strangers" in the grocery store.

    <h2>Story & Setting</h2>
    <p>
      The premise of the story is that a young man has been asked by his mom to
      pick items from the grocery store during the COVID-19 pandemic. A small
      introduction sequence will be shown to set background information. The
      gameplay will take place within a grocery store full of other people.
    </p>

      <img src="./intro_sequence.png" width="700" />
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption">
      The intro sequence mockup up using
      <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw.com</a>.
    </div>

    <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      The core mechanic of the game will movement. Players will use WASD keys
      (or the arrow keys) to navigate throughout the grocery store to collect
      their groceries while carefully avoiding other individuals. Players will
      lose health (the exact amount will be optimized during testing) every time
      they come near another individual and lose instantly if they come in
      contact with another person. Intractable items will allow players to
      reduce the damage caused by other individuals and to recover some of their
      lost health.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of the game will simply be to make it from one side of the
      store to the exit while collecting <i>all</i> food items from the store.
      The game will have multiple levels, each requiring the player to collect a
      new set of items and exit safely. If a player loses on one level, they
      will simply be able to restart that level.
    </p>

    <h2>Movement of Strangers</h2>
    <p>
      The algorithm that determines the movement of others in the grocery store
      (the strangers) is the key to making this game challenging and fun. The
      placement and movement of strangers will need to be carefully coordinated
      to ensure levels are challenging but properly progress in difficulty. To
      make things simple, strangers will move in a predefined pattern with
      varying levels of breaks. For example, in a grid of 32 x 32 blocks, one
      stranger may be programmed to move from position (4, 5) to (4, 9), wait
      for one second, and then move back to (4, 5) before breaking again for
      another second and then finally repeating. Additionally, a stranger may be
      programmed to move between more than two different positions.
    </p>

    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img src="./walking.png" width="400" />
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption">
      Strangers will be preprogrammed to follow defined routes at a specific
      speed and a specific interval. In the above example, this person will talk
      to the "X" point before stopping and travelling to their next location. If
      there are no more locations in their route, they will return to their
      initial position and start again.
    </div>

    <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
    <h3>Masks</h3>
    <p>
      In some levels, players will be able to pick and wear a mask to reduce the
      magnitude of inflicted damage by some factor (to be determined during
      testing). These masks will sometimes be out of the way; however, they may
      still important to complete the level, thus forcing players to retrieve
      the mask.

      A sprite of the mask that will be located within some levels of the game.
      A player will be able to pick this up to reduce the damage inflicted by
      others.
    </div>

    <h3>Sanitization Stations</h3>
    <p>
      Sanitization stations will be located at key locations to help players
      heal throughout levels. These stations may be placed in the middle of
      stores to give players respite if the level is difficult.
    </p>

      A hand washing station that will double as a sanitization station. These
      will be placed at key locations to provide respite for players on
      difficult levels.
    </div>

    <h2>Decorative Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The ensure that the COVID topic is clearly communicated to the user,
      different decorations will be used.
    </p>

    <div class="image-wrapper">

    <div class="image-caption">
      Potential decorations that will be added to levels to make the game more
      unique and to help communicate the theme of the game.
    </div>

    <h2>Audio Style</h2>
    <p>
      The audio style will follow the art style and attempt to use "8-bit"
      sounds as much as possible. The background music of the gameplay will be
      very generic. For example,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap-tFncnV6k"
        >Sounds For The Supermarket</a
      >
      was a jingle created specifically for grocery stores in 1975 and will
      likely be used for the Alpha version. Sound will also be used to indicate
      to the player how much health is remaining. Using builtin
      <code>Game Maker 2</code> audio tools, the pitch of the background music
      increase as players lose health points.
    </p>

    <h2>Development Tools</h2>
    <p>
      <code>Game Maker 2</code> will be used for game development. Playing to my
      strengths, <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> will be used to create
      items such as buttons, modals, text bubbles, etc. This document itself was
      created using web technologies! Additionally, <code>FL Studio</code>, a
      professional Digital Audio Workstation, will be used for audio editing.
    </p>

    <h2>How will the game be received?</h2>
    <p>
      This game attempts to focus on the safety aspects of COVID-19 and avoid
      wording that makes it seem that players become "injected" when they lose.
      Instead, players lose when they don't follow safety guidelines. COVID-19
      is still a very real problem, especially in certain countries/regions, and
      many people are still suffering loss because of this virus. Due to this
      focus on safety and the challenging aspects of the game, the game should
      receive a positive reception.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      COVID Grocery Run will be an action-packed game thatâ€™ll make you wish you
      never had to get groceries again! While playing, players will
      simultaneously learn about important guidelines directly from Public
      Health Canada. Players will be challenged to observe movement patterns and
      to plan their routes carefully so that they can ensure proper social
      distancing. They will also need to learn how to use masks & sanitization
      stations to their advantage. These unique game mechanics coupled with a
      classically designed Action/Adventure RPG will make this fun for all ages!
