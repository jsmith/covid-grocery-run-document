    <h2>Gameplay Example</h2>
    <p>
      You need to get bananas but the produce section is currently very crowded.
      To enter this section, you need to find the non-medical mask because it
      will not be possible to maintain a 2m distance from others upon entering
      this section. Even with the mask, it's important that you avoid others as
      much as possible while getting your bananas.

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    There will only be one distinct character for this game, the individual on a
    mission to find all of their groceries. There will be numerous other people
    walking throughout the store; however, these people will be "strangers" and
    must simply be avoided. Due to the limitations of the selected character
    pack and time constraints, only two sprite sets will be used (selected at
    random for each "stranger") to populate the entire grocery store.

      movement. Two other character sprite sets will be used to animate the

    <h2>Story & Setting</h2>
    <p>
      The premise of the story is that a young man has been asked by his mom to
      pick items from the grocery store during the COVID-19 pandemic. Time
      permitting, a small introduction sequence will be shown to set background
      information. The gameplay will take place within a grocery store full with
      other people.
